# autoextrememathunlocker
A small program written by me and chatgpt to make extrememath unblocking simple
GITHUB PAGE DEPLOYMENT CURRENTLY DOESN'T WORK, DOWNLOAD THE CODE AND OPEN IT ON YOUR SCHOOL COMPUTER (more info below)

to deploy on your chromebook simply download the code from the repo, go to your files, double click the zip file, and double click the "index.html" This will open it in google. If github is blocked and you are looking at this on your home pc, you may be able to transfer index.html onto a usb drive or maybe even an mp3 player??? then plug this into your chromebook and copy it to your files on your chomebook. for even more fun bring to school and let your friends copy the files! (ill test this soon maybe in 1/2 days)

I'll try to update as frequently as possible to keep the suggested link up to date, but at times it may not work if i cannot find any good links.
